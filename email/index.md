# Email Scambaiting
Email Scambaiting is an easy and causal way to get into scambaiting.  You don't need to put much effort into it, and can still get a lot out of it.  Here is some basic information to get you started:

### Fake Email Address
It's really important to **create a scambaiting-only email address**.  This will make sure that the scammers can't dox you, and you don't have to worry about confusing scam and real emails.

Here is a list of good email providers:

- [Gmail](https://gmail.com)
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com)
- [AOL](https://aol.com)
- [FastMail](https://fastmail.fm)

ProtonMail is ideal for privacy and is ad-free, but scammers will often suspect it.  Gmail has been known to ban scambaiters, so keep that in mind.

### Fake Identity
It is a good idea to create a fake identity that you use while email scambaiting.  More advanced email scambaiters even have multiple identities and email accounts, but when you're just starting off you can go to a website like [FauxID](https://fauxid.com/) to generate an identity, and [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) is helpful for generating profile pictures.  You can use this information when creating your email account to make everything appear more ligitmate!

### Grabify (and similar tools)
[Grabify](https://grabify.link) is a great tool for collecting information on scammers.  It will often give you their general location, IP, device, and so on.  Usually there aren't many practical applications for this information, but if you are trying to collect information on a group of scammers (or if you just want to taunt a scammer with their real location), this can be helpful.

As a sidenote, [NorthWatch](https://north.watch) has a module that will send you similar information to grabify whenever a scammer logs into the VM panel.  Usually NorthWatch isn't designed for VM baiting, but if you can find a way to get the scammer to log into your bank, this could be helpful!
